    "# The increasing threat of wildfires in the U.S.A.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most visible and dramatic outcomes of climate change in the United States is the growing frequency of large wildfires. The west coast region and Alaska are particularly susceptible, and in recent years there have been several dramatic events where smoke turned entire skiesorange and opaque, like in the image below. The dangers of wildfires are obvious. They threaten infrastructure, ecosystems, and human lives. Understanding how wildfires will look in the future is a crucial part of mitigating their impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this webpage I present an analysis of a publicly available [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition) of 2.3 million wildfires within the U.S.A. between 1992 and 2020. I show that the occurence of fires is cyclical--oscillating between relatively heavy and low fire abundances with a period of 2-3 years. Underlying the oscillations is an increasing trend in the typical fire size and the total annual surface area affected by fires. Approximately 190,000 additional acres per year are affected by fires, on average. Large fires are becoming more frequent quicker than smaller fires. During years of peak activity between 2015-2020, there was nearly double the total acreage affected by large fires when compared to the average over the 1992-2020 period. Lastly, a spatial map of wildfire activity demonstrates that the western coast of the conintental U.S. and Alaska are more suspectible to wildfires than other regions.\n",

    "## Overview of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in the data set includes the date the fire was discovered, the size of the fire damage in acres, the [letter class](https://www.nwcg.gov/term/glossary/size-class-of-fire) of the size of the fire (A-G), the cause of the fire, and the approximate latitude and longitude of the fire, among several other things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of all fire sizes from 1992-2020, plotted below, we see there are many entries for fires < 10 acres. The distribution at this small size end features strong peaks that are most definitely as result of manual rounding to convenient, integer fractions (e.g. 1 acre, 1/2, 1/4, 2, 3, etc.). Thus, **for the rest of this analysis, I am only going to look at the fires above 100 acres (or class D)**, to focus on the fires that are capable of doing the most damage, or potentially growing into catastrophic fires if they are not controlled in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below figure, the region bounded by the dotted lines in the left panel (fires > 100 acres) is enlarged in the right panel. The fire class letter boundaries are also shown the right panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the data on both axes are presented in logarithmic spacing. The high-end fire size distribution is exponential: there are significantly more 100-acre fires than 100,000-acre fires."

    "The following figure shows the median, mean, total number of fires, and sum of the wildfire surface area affected over time, from 1992-2020. In these data, the cyclical, osciallatory behavior of wildfire activity is apparent. Fire presence oscillates between maxima and minimuma over the course of 2-3 year periods. Previous plots demonstrated strong daily and annual cycles in activity, which suggests these super-annual cycles are a result of some larger climate pattern that is decoupled from either annual or daily temperature fluctuations. Alarmingly, all lines with the exception of the total number of fires appear to be gradually increasing. Both the upper and lower bounds of the peaks of the oscillation increase with time. For example, from 1992-1996, the total wildfire burn oscillated between ~2 and 4 million acres per year, while the totals from 2016-2020 were between 4 and 10 million.\n",

The residuals display a biomodal distribution with peaks near $\\pm(0.5-1)$ standard deviation. It would be beneficial to extend this dataset to include the extra two years to the current date, or find archival data from before 1992, if possible.

The sum is represented as a ratio to the mean annual total fire size area over the full 1992-2020 period.
